Django coltrane
===============

This is a simple blog that the user is asked to create throughout chapters 4-7 of Practical Django Projects 2nd Edition by James Bennett, published by Apress.  

The main difference between this coltrane app and the app outlined in Practical Django Projects is that this version does not have comments. Users must implement their own comments using another app. I highly recommend using disqus comments.

The original version of James Bennett's coltrane blog app is found at:

A very nice unofficial repository of the code written in Practial Django Projects 2nd Edition is found at:
